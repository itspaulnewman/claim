  <h2><strong>What Is the Ford Emissions Claim?</strong></h2>
<p>The Ford emissions claim centers around allegations that Ford manipulated emissions testing for certain diesel vehicles. This manipulation allegedly allowed vehicles to pass regulatory tests while emitting pollutants well above legal limits during real-world driving conditions.</p>
<h2>Key Allegations:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Defeat Devices</strong>: Similar to other automakers accused of emissions fraud, Ford allegedly used software to alter how vehicles performed during emissions tests<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-diesel-emissions-20180110-story.html">2</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Affected Models</strong>: The claims primarily target Ford's F-250 and F-350 Super Duty diesel trucks sold between 2011 and 2017. These trucks reportedly emitted nitrogen oxide pollutants up to 50 times the legal limit<a href="https://www.latimes.com/business/autos/la-fi-hy-ford-diesel-emissions-20180110-story.html">2</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Consumer Impact</strong>: Owners paid a premium for these vehicles under the impression they were environmentally friendly, only to discover they may have contributed to significant environmental harm.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Legal Actions Against Ford</strong></h2>
<h2>Past Settlements</h2>
<p>Ford has faced multiple legal challenges over emissions violations. For instance, in 1997, the company settled with the EPA for $7.8 million over allegations of installing defeat devices in Econoline vans.</p>
<h2>Ongoing Lawsuits</h2>
<p>In recent years, Ford has been accused of rigging diesel trucks to beat emissions tests. A class-action lawsuit filed in 2018 claimed that these vehicles were marketed as "clean diesel" while their real-world performance grossly exceeded pollution standards.</p>
<h2>Criminal Probes</h2>
<p>In 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into Ford's emissions certification process after employees raised concerns about incorrect calculations used in testing data.</p>
<h2><strong>How Does This Impact Consumers?</strong></h2>
<p>The Ford emissions claim has far-reaching implications for consumers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Financial Losses</strong>: Many buyers paid a premium for "clean diesel" technology that failed to deliver on its promises.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Environmental Concerns</strong>: Excessive nitrogen oxide emissions contribute to smog, respiratory issues, and environmental degradation.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Legal Rights</strong>: Affected vehicle owners may be entitled to compensation through class-action lawsuits or settlements.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
